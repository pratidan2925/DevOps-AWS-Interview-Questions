**What is Docker ?**

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications in lightweight, portable containers. Docker containers package software and its dependencies in a standardized unit, ensuring that the application runs consistently across different environments, whether on a developer's laptop, on-premises servers, or in the cloud.

**What is the use of Docker ?**
Consistent Environment: Docker ensures that applications run the same in development, testing, and production environments by packaging the application and its dependencies in a container.
Isolation: Containers provide process and resource isolation, enabling multiple applications or services to run on the same host without interfering with each other.
Portability: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making it easy to move applications between environments or cloud providers.
Scalability: Docker facilitates the scaling of applications by allowing the creation of multiple container instances, which can be managed by orchestration tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.
Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and use fewer resources compared to virtual machines because they share the host system's OS kernel.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Docker integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated testing, building, and deployment of applications.

What is a Container?
A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers provide an isolated environment for running applications, ensuring that they run consistently regardless of the host environment.

Explain the difference between COPY and ADD in a Dockerfile.
Answer: Both COPY and ADD are used to copy files from the host to the Docker image, but ADD has additional functionalities. ADD can copy files from a URL and automatically extract tar archives, while COPY simply copies files and directories.


What is different between p and P in docker
-p(small) <host_port>:<container_port>: This flag is used to map a specific port on the host machine to a specific port on the Docker container. For example, -p 8080:80 maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 on the container. This is useful when you need to expose a particular port of your application to the outside world or other services.
-P(Capital): This flag is used to publish all exposed ports of the container to random ports on the host machine. Docker will automatically assign high-order, dynamically allocated ports (above 32767) to each exposed port within the container. For example, if a container has multiple exposed ports, using -P will map each of them to a unique, random port on the host.
-p(small): Maps a specific port of the host to a specific port of the container.
-P(Capital): Maps all exposed ports of the container to random ports on the host.

Docker image vs docker stack
Docker Image: An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. It contains the application code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed to run the application. Images are created from a Dockerfile and are the basis for creating containers.
Docker Stack: A stack is a collection of multiple services that make up an application. It is defined using a docker-compose.yml file, which describes how to deploy and interconnect various services (containers). Docker Stack allows you to deploy a multi-container application as a single unit using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for orchestration.

How to debug Docker
Logs: Use docker logs <container_id> to retrieve the logs from a specific container. This helps in understanding what happened inside the container.
Exec into Container: Use docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash to get an interactive shell inside the running container. This is useful for manual inspection and troubleshooting.
Inspect: Use docker inspect <container_id> to get detailed information about the containerâ€™s configuration, state, and networking. This command provides JSON output with extensive details.
Check Docker Daemon Logs: Review Docker daemon logs using journalctl -u docker.service or sudo cat /var/log/docker.log (location may vary by system).
Network Troubleshooting: Use commands like docker network ls, docker network inspect, and docker network connect to diagnose and resolve network issues.

Check Docker Service: Ensure Docker is running using systemctl status docker or service docker status.
List Containers: Use docker ps -a to list all containers, including stopped ones, to see if the container has stopped or failed.
Start/Restart Docker: If Docker service is not running, restart it using systemctl restart docker.
Container Logs: Check the logs of the container using docker logs <container_id> to understand why it stopped.
Inspect Container: Use docker inspect <container_id> to get detailed information and potential reasons for the issue.
Check System Resources: Ensure that there are enough system resources (CPU, memory, disk space) available for Docker.

How to orchestrate DOCKER container
Docker Swarm: A native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker. It allows you to create a swarm of Docker nodes and manage them as a single cluster, distributing containers across the nodes, scaling services, and managing the lifecycle of containers.
Commands:
docker swarm init: Initialize a new swarm.
docker service create: Deploy a new service in the swarm.
docker service scale: Scale services up or down.
Kubernetes: An open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts. It provides advanced orchestration capabilities, including self-healing, scaling, and load balancing.
Components:
Pods: The smallest deployable units that can contain one or more containers.
Services: A way to expose an application running on a set of pods as a network service.
Deployments: Manage the deployment and scaling of a set of pods.

What is docker application
A Docker application is a software application packaged in a Docker container. This container includes everything the application needs to run, such as the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Docker applications can be easily deployed, scaled, and managed across different environments, ensuring consistency and reliability
How to create docker image from docker container
Commit the Container: Use docker commit <container_id> <new_image_name> to create a new image from the changes made in a running container. This captures the current state of the container as a new image.
Tag and Push (Optional): Tag the new image and push it to a Docker registry if you want to share it.

What is docker policy to start docker container automatically
Docker provides restart policies to control whether your containers start automatically when they exit, or when Docker restarts. These policies can be set using the --restart flag:
no: Do not automatically restart the container (default).
on-failure: Restart the container only if it exits with a non-zero exit status. You can optionally specify the maximum number of restart attempts (e.g., on-failure:5).
always: Always restart the container regardless of the exit status.
unless-stopped: Always restart the container except when the container is manually stopped.
Example:
docker run --restart=always my_image
These policies help ensure that your containers remain running and are resilient to failures or system restarts.
