#### Explain Waterfall model
The Waterfall Model is a sequential software development process where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) is completed before moving to the next. 
- Drawbacks include inflexibility to changes, limited customer involvement, late issue detection, long delivery times, poor risk management, and late visibility of the working software.

 #### What is an Agile model ?
-The Agile Model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.
- It involves breaking down the project into small, manageable increments called iterations or sprints.
- Each iteration typically lasts from one to four weeks and includes all phases of development: planning, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and review.
- Throughout the process, there's a continuous focus on adapting to change and delivering value to the customer.
- Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, promote self-organizing teams, frequent communication, and the delivery of working software at the end of each iteration.
- This approach allows for quicker responses to changing requirements, better alignment with customer needs, and improved overall project transparency.
