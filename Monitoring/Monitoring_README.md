#### How do you monitor PostgreSQL and Prometheus?
Answer:
PostgreSQL Monitoring:
pg_stat_statements: Use the pg_stat_statements extension to track SQL query performance.
pgAdmin: Utilize pgAdmin for a GUI-based monitoring solution.
Custom Scripts: Write custom monitoring scripts to track key metrics like query performance, connection count, and replication status.
Prometheus Exporter: Deploy the PostgreSQL Exporter to collect and expose PostgreSQL metrics to Prometheus.
Prometheus Monitoring:
Node Exporter: Use the Node Exporter to collect hardware and OS metrics from servers.
Custom Metrics: Instrument applications to expose custom metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape.
Grafana: Integrate Prometheus with Grafana to visualize metrics and create dashboards for real-time monitoring.
Alerting: Set up alerting rules in Prometheus to notify of any anomalies or critical issues.

Tell me your experience with monitoring.
Answer: My experience with monitoring includes using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance and application metrics. Iâ€™ve set up alerting and visualization to monitor various metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and application response times. This helps in identifying and resolving issues proactively.
Do you have experience with monitoring systems?
Yes, I have experience with various monitoring systems, including Prometheus, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch, and ELK Stack. These tools help track system performance, logs, and alerts.
How do you set up the dashboards in Grafana?
Answer: To set up dashboards in Grafana, you first configure data sources to connect to monitoring systems like Prometheus or InfluxDB. Next, you create a new dashboard and add panels to visualize the data. Panels can display metrics in various formats, such as graphs, tables, or heatmaps. Dashboards can be customized with queries, filters, and alerts to provide insights into system performance and application health.
You stored logs in Prometheus?
Answer: No, Prometheus is primarily used for monitoring and metrics, not for log storage. For log management, tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Fluentd, or Loki are typically used. Prometheus stores time-series data and metrics, which is different from the log data collected by these other tools.
What did you use for saving logs if not Prometheus?
Answer: For saving logs, I have used tools such as ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Fluentd. These tools are designed for log aggregation, storage, and analysis, providing capabilities for searching and visualizing log data.
