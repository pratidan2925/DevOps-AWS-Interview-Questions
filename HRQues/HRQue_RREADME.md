Stress management techniques like deep breathing or stepping away briefly also help me stay sharp and productive.

#### 4. How do you manage work issues and conflict?
Answer:
To manage conflicts, I first ensure open and clear communication to understand each person's perspective. I believe in addressing conflicts early before they escalate, encouraging a collaborative approach to problem-solving. I remain neutral, listen to all sides, and work on finding a compromise that meets the team’s objectives while fostering respect. If necessary, I escalate the issue to management while ensuring it doesn't impact the team’s overall performance.

#### 5. Suppose you have a deadline and need to work extra time. How do you manage that?
Answer:
If a deadline is approaching and extra work is required, I first evaluate the task's scope and prioritize the most critical aspects. I am open to working longer hours but ensure that I pace myself to avoid burnout. Proper time management, such as setting milestones and focusing on high-impact activities, helps me meet deadlines efficiently. If needed, I communicate with stakeholders about the extra effort required and align on any possible deadline extensions.

#### 6. What strategies can you employ to meet deadlines?
Answer:
Clear Task Prioritization: Break down tasks and prioritize based on impact and urgency.
