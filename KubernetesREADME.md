#### Kubernetes vs. Docker

Definition:

Docker is a container platform focused on creating and managing containers.
Kubernetes is an orchestration platform that manages containerized applications across a cluster of machines.
Functionality:

Kubernetes provides features like auto-scaling and self-healing, which are essential for maintaining application availability.
Docker, being a single-node platform, does not inherently offer these orchestration capabilities.
Scalability:

Kubernetes allows for the creation of clusters that can manage multiple nodes, ensuring high availability.
If a node in a Kubernetes cluster fails, workloads can be automatically moved to another node, minimizing downtime.
Kubernetes Architecture Components

Control Plane:

Includes the API server, responsible for handling requests and managing the cluster's state.
The scheduler allocates resources to various workloads based on predefined criteria.
Data Plane:

Comprises components like kubelet, which manages the lifecycle of pods, and kube-proxy, which handles network routing and load balancing.
Container runtime, which is the environment where containers run; Kubernetes supports multiple runtimes.
Storage:

etcd serves as a key-value store for all Kubernetes objects, ensuring data persistence and consistency across the cluster.
Kubernetes Services Types

Cluster IP:

The default service type that provides a virtual IP address accessible only within the cluster.
Ideal for internal communication among services.
NodePort:

Exposes a service on a static port on each node's IP address, allowing external access to the service through the node's IP and port.
Useful for exposing services without requiring a load balancer.
LoadBalancer:

Creates an external load balancer in supported cloud environments, providing a public IP for accessing the service.
Facilitates external traffic management and scaling.
Namespaces in Kubernetes

Logical Isolation:

Namespaces provide a method to separate resources within the same cluster, allowing multiple teams or projects to coexist without interfering with each other.
Each namespace can have its own set of resources, policies, and access controls.
Resource Management:

Helps in organizing resources in a multi-tenant environment, ensuring that teams can manage their projects independently.
Facilitates resource quota management and limits on resource consumption per namespace.
RBAC Integration:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can be used to enforce security policies within namespaces, allowing for fine-grained access control.
Teams can be restricted to their own namespaces, enhancing security and management efficiency.
Kubernetes Interview Preparation

Common Questions:

Candidates should be prepared to explain the differences between Docker containers and Kubernetes pods, as well as the main components of Kubernetes architecture.
Understanding the role of kube-proxy, kubelet, and service types is crucial for interviews.
Practical Knowledge:

Familiarity with day-to-day operations in a Kubernetes environment, including deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting, is often assessed.
Knowledge of scaling applications, managing configurations, and implementing security practices in Kubernetes is essential.
Mock Interviews:

Engaging in mock interviews can help assess understanding and readiness, allowing candidates to practice articulating their knowledge effectively.
Reflecting on personal scores or feedback from peers can enhance learning and preparation for actual interviews.
