#### What is cloud computing ?
Cloud computing is a technology that provides access to computing resources over the internet, such as servers, storage, and applications. Users can access these resources on-demand, pay only for what they use, and scale up or down as needed. It offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, and is available through public, private, and hybrid deployment models.
Explain types of Cloud
1.       Public Cloud: Services offered by third-party providers over the internet, shared among multiple users for scalability and cost-efficiency.
2.       Private Cloud: Cloud infrastructure exclusively for a single organization, providing greater control, customization, and security.
3.       Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private clouds, offering flexibility to meet specific needs, such as scalability and security requirements.

#### Explain IaaS ,PaaS , SaaS
1.       IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, and networking. Users have control over operating systems, applications, and development frameworks. Examples include AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure VMs.
2.       PaaS (Platform as a Service): Offers a platform with tools and services to develop, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure. Developers can focus on coding and application development. Examples include Google App Engine, Heroku.
3.       SaaS (Software as a Service): Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access applications through web browsers without needing to install or maintain software locally. Examples include Gmail, Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365.


What are the differences between Azure PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS services? Explain.
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users manage OS, storage, and applications while the provider manages hardware, networking, and virtualization. Example: Azure Virtual Machines.
PaaS (Platform as a Service): Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development. Users manage applications and data while the provider manages OS, hardware, and middleware. Example: Azure App Services.
SaaS (Software as a Service): Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. Users access the software while the provider manages everything else. Example: Microsoft Office 365.
ow would you perform basic administrative tasks on a Windows Server 2016?
Basic administrative tasks on Windows Server 2016 can be performed using tools such as the Server Manager, PowerShell, and Remote Desktop. Tasks include managing user accounts, configuring network settings, installing roles and features, monitoring system performance, and applying updates and patches.
6. How to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers
Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools:Use tools like Terraform or Pulumi to define infrastructure as code, enabling consistent configurations across providers.
Multi-Cloud Management Platforms:Use platforms like Kubernetes, CloudHealth, or RightScale to manage and monitor resources across different clouds.
Standardize Configuration and Automation:Implement CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate deployments.
Centralized Monitoring and Logging:Use services like Datadog, Prometheus, or ELK Stack to centralize monitoring and logging.
Security and Compliance:Use tools like HashiCorp Vault for secrets management and cloud-native security services to ensure compliance.
