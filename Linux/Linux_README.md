# Linux

#### What is Linux

- Linux is an open-source operating system kernel developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It's the core component of various Linux distributions (or distros) such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it popular for use in servers, desktop computers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. It supports a wide range of software and is highly customizable to meet different needs.

#### how to give permission to Linux ?  And What is chmod ?

"chmod" is a command in Linux used to change permissions for files and directories. It allows you to specify who can read, write, or execute a file or directory. You can use symbolic or octal notation to set permissions. For example, chmod u+x file.txt adds execute permission for the owner of "file.txt", while chmod 755 file.txt gives the owner full permissions and read/execute permissions to the group and others.

- Read -  4      

- write - 2     

- execute - 1

#### What is the key difference  between Linux server and ubuntu server?

Linux Server: "Linux server" refers to any server operating system based on the Linux kernel. It's a broad term encompassing various distributions (distros) like Ubuntu Server, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, etc. Each distribution may have its own package management system, default software, and support policies.

- Ubuntu Server: Ubuntu Server is a specific distribution of Linux tailored for server environments. It's maintained by Canonical and is based on the Debian architecture. Ubuntu Server is known for its ease of use, regular updates, strong community support, and compatibility with a wide range of software packages. It's often chosen for web servers, cloud deployments, and enterprise applications.
In essence, while "Linux server" is a generic term referring to any server running a Linux-based operating system, "Ubuntu server" specifically denotes a server running the Ubuntu distribution of Linux.

# WINDOWS

 #### Why linux is more secure than windows explain in short.
 Linux is often seen as more secure than Windows for a few simple reasons:
**Open Source:** Since the code is open for everyone to see, many people can check and fix security problems quickly.
**User Permissions:** Linux restricts what regular users can do, making it harder for viruses to cause damage.
**Built-In Security:** It has strong security tools like SELinux and AppArmor that help protect the system.
**Variety:** There are many different versions of Linux, so a virus for one version might not work on another.
**Less Targeted:** Fewer people use Linux compared to Windows, so it's less of a target for hackers.
These factors make Linux generally more secure.


#### Difference between Linux and windows
**Source Code:**
Linux: Open source, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute the code.
Windows: Closed source, proprietary software owned by Microsoft.
**Cost:**
Linux: Generally free to use and distribute.
Windows: Requires a paid license.
**User Permissions:**
Linux: Enforces strict user permissions and roles, enhancing security.
Windows: Uses a user account control system, which is less strict compared to Linux.
**Customization:**
Linux: Highly customizable, from the kernel to the user interface.
Windows: Limited customization options; changes are mostly superficial (e.g., themes).
**Software Installation:**
Linux: Uses package managers (e.g., apt, yum) to install software from repositories.
Windows: Software is typically installed using executable (.exe) files from various sources.
**Security:**
Linux: Generally considered more secure due to its permissions system, smaller user base, and open-source nature.
Windows: More targeted by malware due to its larger user base and popularity.
**Performance:**
Linux: Known for its efficiency and performance, particularly on older hardware.
Windows: Requires more resources, especially for newer versions.
