 # Shell Script

#### What is shell script
A shell script is a text file with commands for a Unix-based operating system's shell to execute, automating tasks, and processes. These scripts can use variables, loops, conditionals, and functions, making them powerful for system management. Common shells include Bash, widely used on Linux and macOS.

#### What is Shebang?
In Linux, a shebang is a special character sequence at the beginning of a script file that specifies the interpreter to be used to execute the script. It consists of a hash character (#) followed by an exclamation mark (!), hence the name "shebang."
For example, the shebang line #!/bin/bash indicates that the script should be executed using the Bash shell interpreter located at /bin/bash.


#### Explain Korn shell vs bash shell
       Korn shell is older than Bash shell: Korn shell was developed in the 1980s, while Bash shell was developed in the 1990s. As a result, Korn shell is more widely used in older systems, while Bash shell is more common in modern systems.
    Syntax: Both shells have a similar syntax and share many of the same commands. However, there are some differences in syntax, such as the way arrays are declared and indexed.
Features: Bash shell has more features than Korn shell, including command line editing, history, and tab completion. It also has more advanced programming features such as regular expressions and process substitution.
   Compatibility: Bash shell is backward compatible with the Bourne shell (sh), which means that scripts written for sh can be run with bash without modification. Korn shell is not fully compatible with sh, which means that some sh scripts may need to be modified to run on ksh.
