Route 53
1. What Is Amazon Route 53?
Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by AWS. It translates friendly domain names like www.example.com into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the internet.
2. How Amazon Route 53 Works?
Route 53 routes end users to internet applications by translating domain names into IP addresses. It does this by responding to DNS queries, which are requests for domain name resolution. Route 53 can route traffic based on various routing policies and health checks.
3. Amazon Route 53 Benefits:
Scalability: Route 53 automatically scales to handle a large volume of DNS queries without intervention.
High Availability: It provides a reliable and redundant DNS service with global coverage using AWS's infrastructure.
Performance: Route 53 includes features like latency-based routing and Geo DNS to route traffic based on the lowest latency or geographic location of users.
Integration: It integrates well with other AWS services like EC2, ELB (Elastic Load Balancing), and CloudFront.
DNS Security: Route 53 supports DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) to provide cryptographic authentication of DNS responses.
4. Amazon Route 53 Limitations:
Cost: Route 53 charges for hosted zones, queries answered, health checks, and other features, which can vary based on usage.
Complexity: Configuring advanced routing policies and integrating with some non-AWS services may require additional setup and understanding.
Global Propagation: While Route 53 is designed for low-latency DNS resolution globally, DNS changes may take some time to propagate across the internet.
5. Does AWS Offer Route 53 Monitoring Capabilities?
AWS Route 53 itself primarily provides DNS resolution and routing capabilities. For monitoring, AWS offers CloudWatch which can monitor Route 53 health checks and integrate with other AWS services for comprehensive monitoring and alerting.
6. AWS Routing Policies:
Route 53 supports several routing policies to determine how traffic is routed to your resources:
Simple Routing: Maps a domain name directly to an IP address or to multiple IP addresses, such as for a single resource.
Weighted Routing: Divides traffic among multiple resources based on assigned weights, allowing for load balancing or testing deployments.
Latency-based Routing: Routes traffic based on the lowest network latency from the user to the AWS region hosting your application.
Failover Routing: Provides an active-passive setup where traffic is routed to a standby resource in case the primary resource is unhealthy.
Geolocation Routing: Routes traffic based on the geographic location of users, allowing you to provide localized content or services.
7. AWS Route Tables:
Route tables in AWS are used in VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) to determine where network traffic is directed. They are not directly related to Route 53, which is a DNS service. Route 53 manages DNS resolution, while route tables handle network routing within VPCs.
8. AWS Route 53 Key Features:
DNS Failover: Automatically routes traffic away from failed endpoints to healthy ones.
Health Checks: Monitors the health and availability of endpoints, such as web servers or load balancers.
Traffic Flow: Allows visual editing of global routing policies for dynamic traffic management.
Private DNS: Resolves domain names within your VPCs without exposing DNS queries to the public internet.
Domain Registration: Allows you to register new domain names or transfer existing ones directly within AWS.
9. Hands-on: Creating a Hosted Zone:
To create a hosted zone in Route 53, you typically start by registering a domain name or using an existing one. Then, you create records within the hosted zone to specify how traffic should be routed for that domain.
10. What Is the Purpose of Route 53 in AWS?
The main purpose of Route 53 is to provide a reliable and scalable DNS service that translates domain names into IP addresses, thus enabling end users to access applications and resources hosted on AWS or elsewhere on the internet.
11. What Is the Difference Between DNS and Route 53?
DNS (Domain Name System) is a distributed naming system that translates domain names into IP addresses. Route 53 is AWS's managed DNS service that provides DNS resolution, routing policies, health checks, and domain registration.
12. What Is Name Server in Route 53?
Name servers are DNS servers that Route 53 uses to manage DNS queries for your domain names. When you create a hosted zone in Route 53, AWS assigns name servers that you delegate to from your domain registrar to manage DNS resolution for your domain.
13. Why Is It Called Route 53?
The name "Route 53" comes from the fact that TCP and UDP use port 53 for DNS traffic. It's a nod to the fundamental role of DNS in routing internet traffic.
14. How Do I Create a Domain Name on Route 53?
You can create or transfer domain names to Route 53 through the AWS Management Console or using AWS APIs. Registering a domain involves specifying the domain name, contact information, and configuring DNS settings.
15. What Are the Three Main Functions of Route 53?
The three main functions of Route 53 are:
DNS Routing: Resolving domain names to IP addresses.
Health Checking: Monitoring the health of endpoints.
Traffic Management: Routing traffic based on various policies like latency, geolocation, and weighted distribution.
16. Which Port Is DNS?
DNS typically uses port 53 for both TCP and UDP traffic.
17. What DNS Does EC2 Use?
EC2 instances can use Route 53 for DNS resolution by default when configured within a VPC. Route 53 resolves domain names for EC2 instances and other AWS services.
18. What If AWS Load Balancer Fails?
If an AWS load balancer fails, Route 53 can automatically reroute traffic away from the failed load balancer to healthy instances using health checks and DNS failover policies.
19. What Is the Fastest DNS Server?
The fastest DNS server can vary depending on network conditions and geographic location. Route 53 leverages global anycast routing to provide low-latency DNS resolution globally.
20. What Are the 3 Types of Load Balancers in AWS?
AWS provides three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers (ALB), Network Load Balancers (NLB), and Classic Load Balancers (deprecated, replaced by ALB and NLB).
21. What Is the Difference Between Route 53 and ELB?
Route 53 is a DNS service that resolves domain names to IP addresses and routes traffic to resources, including AWS load balancers (ELB/ALB/NLB). ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) is a service that distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances.

For Windows instances, the private key is required to decrypt the administrator password, which you then use to connect to your instance.


## what is region and Availability zone
In AWS, a region is a geographical area where AWS data centers are located. Each region consists of multiple isolated locations called Availability Zones (AZs). Availability Zones are distinct data centers within a region that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other AZs, while still being interconnected through low-latency links.
**1.       Region:**

A geographic area where AWS infrastructure is physically located.

Example: US East (N. Virginia), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Tokyo).

Each region operates independently and is isolated from other regions.

**2.       Availability Zone (AZ):**

Isolated locations within a region, typically separate data centers.

Designed to be fault-tolerant, meaning failures in one AZ should not affect others.

Allows customers to run applications in multiple AZs for high availability and fault tolerance.

# IAM
 
## What is IAM?
IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service in AWS that allows you to control access to AWS services and resources. It enables you to create and manage users, groups, and roles, define fine-grained access policies, set up multi-factor authentication (MFA), and monitor user activity.

## Difference between Authentication and Authorization
Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity.
In AWS, authentication involves proving the identity of users or services attempting to access AWS resources.
This is typically done through credentials such as usernames, passwords, access keys, or temporary security tokens.
Common authentication mechanisms in AWS includAWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Single Sign-On (SSO), and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
Authorization:
Authorization is the process of determining what actions a user or entity is allowed to perform after they have been authenticated.
In AWS, authorization involves granting permissions to users or services based on their identity and the policies associated with their credentials.
This is done through IAM policies, which define the permissions that users or entities have to AWS resources.
IAM policies specify what actions are allowed or denied on which AWS resources, based on various conditions such as user identity, resource attributes, and requested actions.
 
## Inline policy
An inline policy in AWS IAM is a policy directly attached to a specific IAM user, group, or role, providing granular control over permissions. It's managed within the configuration of the IAM entity to which it's attached.

## IM Manager
Identity Management (IM) Manager: This might refer to a system or software used for managing user identities, access controls, and permissions within an organization's IT infrastructure. Examples include Microsoft Active Directory, LDAP directories, or cloud-based identity management platforms.

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS. Configuration involves setting up an EKS cluster, creating worker nodes, and configuring kubectl to manage the cluster.


#### 15. In VPC, How to Identify Which Subnet is Private and Which Subnet is Public?
Answer:
Public Subnet: A public subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway, allowing resources within the subnet to access the internet.
Private Subnet: A private subnet is associated with a route table that does not have a route to an internet gateway, restricting direct access to the internet. Typically, traffic from private subnets can access the internet via a NAT gateway or NAT instance.

#### How do you execute jobs in AWS?
AWS provides various services to execute jobs, such as AWS Lambda for serverless execution, AWS Batch for batch processing jobs, AWS Step Functions for orchestrating workflows, and AWS ECS/EKS for containerized jobs. You can use the AWS Management Console, CLI, SDKs, or Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform to configure and trigger these jobs.

#### What is VPC?
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have full control over your virtual networking environment, including selecting your own IP address range, creating subnets, and configuring route tables and network gateways.

#### How can you define a public and private subnet in VPC?
A public subnet is one that has a route to an Internet Gateway, allowing instances within the subnet to communicate directly with the internet. A private subnet does not have a route to an Internet Gateway but can connect to the internet via a NAT Gateway or NAT instance in a public subnet.

#### How an EC2 instance can fetch something from the internet?
An EC2 instance can fetch something from the internet if it is in a public subnet with an associated Elastic IP or public IP address and a route to an Internet Gateway. If in a private subnet, it can access the internet using a NAT Gateway or NAT instance in a public subnet.
#### How does a request from the app go to the internet?
For a request from an app on an EC2 instance to reach the internet, the instance must have a route to an Internet Gateway (for public subnets) or through a NAT Gateway/NAT instance (for private subnets). Additionally, security groups and NACLs must allow outbound traffic to the desired internet destinations.


#### If you restrict the security group, NACL, and the NAT Gateways, then how can you connect and fetch something from S3?
You can use VPC endpoints for S3, which allow instances in a VPC to securely access S3 without traversing the internet. You must configure the endpoint in your VPC and update route tables and security groups to allow traffic to the endpoint.

#### What is the difference between NACL and Security groups?
Security Groups are stateful and operate at the instance level, automatically allowing return traffic. NACLs (Network ACLs) are stateless and operate at the subnet level, requiring explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic. Security Groups are generally easier to manage for instance-level security, while NACLs offer an additional layer of control at the subnet level.

#### AMI and snapshot difference?
An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template for creating an EC2 instance and includes an operating system, application server, and applications. A snapshot is a point-in-time backup of an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume, which can be used to create new volumes or restore data to an existing volume.


#### What will you do to make your application more secure?
To make an application more secure, you can implement several measures:
Use IAM roles and policies to enforce the principle of least privilege.
Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Regularly update and patch your systems and software.
Monitor and audit access and activity using services like AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config.
Use security groups and NACLs to control traffic to and from your instances.
Implement secure coding practices and conduct regular security reviews and testing.


#### What is the difference between ALB and NLB?
ALB (Application Load Balancer) operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and supports advanced routing features, such as host-based and path-based routing, and provides SSL termination. NLB (Network Load Balancer) operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and is designed for high performance, low latency, and handling millions of requests per second. NLB can also handle TCP and UDP traffic, while ALB is focused on HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
How to give bucket access to one user without console access?
You can give bucket access to a user by creating an IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions (e.g., s3
, s3
) and attaching it to the IAM user. This allows the user to interact with the S3 bucket programmatically via the AWS CLI, SDKs, or API without needing console access.

#### Is there any possible way to recover the object after deleted?
If S3 versioning is enabled on the bucket, you can recover a deleted object by retrieving a previous version of the object. If versioning is not enabled, the object cannot be recovered after deletion.

#### How to restrict or give permission to a specific object?
To restrict or give permission to a specific object, you can use bucket policies, IAM policies, or object ACLs (Access Control Lists). These policies can specify actions (e.g., s3
) and conditions to allow or deny access to specific objects.


#### What are inline-based policies?
Inline policies are policies that are directly attached to a single IAM user, group, or role. They are useful for specific permissions that are not intended to be reused. Unlike managed policies, inline policies are not shared and are directly associated with the entity to which they are attached.

#### How to access the S3 bucket privately?
To access an S3 bucket privately, you can:
Use VPC endpoints to route traffic to S3 without using the public internet.
Configure bucket policies and IAM policies to restrict access to specific VPCs or IP ranges.
Use S3 access points to create specific access policies.


#### What is the difference between a NAT instance and a NAT Gateway?
NAT Instance:

A deployment is going on and at the same time auto scaling happens (just coincidence). When the auto scaling happens and the deployment will deploy the new code to existing servers and then auto scaling happens and the image (AMI) that has been saved in the auto scaling group is the older one. So when the auto scaling happens, a new server comes up that has an old code and one of the existing servers has the new code. How will you eliminate this problem?
To eliminate this problem, you can use immutable infrastructure practices. Ensure that the AMI used by the auto-scaling group is updated to match the latest deployment code before the scaling event occurs. You can achieve this by integrating your CI/CD pipeline to trigger AMI updates as part of the deployment process. This way, new instances launched by auto-scaling will always use the updated AMI.
