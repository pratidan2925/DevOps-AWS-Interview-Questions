#### What is cloud computing ?
Cloud computing is a technology that provides access to computing resources over the internet, such as servers, storage, and applications. Users can access these resources on-demand, pay only for what they use, and scale up or down as needed. It offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, and is available through public, private, and hybrid deployment models.
Explain types of Cloud
1.       Public Cloud: Services offered by third-party providers over the internet, shared among multiple users for scalability and cost-efficiency.
2.       Private Cloud: Cloud infrastructure exclusively for a single organization, providing greater control, customization, and security.
3.       Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private clouds, offering flexibility to meet specific needs, such as scalability and security requirements.

2.       PaaS (Platform as a Service): Offers a platform with tools and services to develop, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure. Developers can focus on coding and application development. Examples include Google App Engine, Heroku.
3.       SaaS (Software as a Service): Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access applications through web browsers without needing to install or maintain software locally. Examples include Gmail, Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365.
