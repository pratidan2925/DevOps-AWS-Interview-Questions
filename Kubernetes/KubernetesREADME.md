# Kubernetes

#### 1. Difference between Docker and Kubernetes
- Docker is a container platform while Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform.
- Kubernetes offers features like auto healing, auto scaling, cluster management, and enterprise capabilities.
  
---
#### 2.Cloud Control Manager in Kubernetes
- On a broad level, you can divide the kubernetes components in two parts

1. Control Plane (API SERVER, SCHEDULER, Controller Manager, C-CM, ETCD)

2. Data Plane (Kubelet, Kube-proxy, Container Runtime)
---
#### 3. What are the main differences between the Docker Swarm and Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes is better suited for large organisations as it offers more scalability, networking capabilities like policies and huge third party ecosystem 
---
#### 4.Difference between Docker container and Kubernetes pod
- A pod is a runtime specification in Kubernetes written in YAML files
- A pod can have one or multiple containers that can communicate using the same network and share resources
---
#### 5.What is a namespace in Kubernetes ?

- In Kubernetes namespace is a logical isolation of resources, network policies, rbac and everything. For example, there are two projects using same k8s cluster. One project can use ns1 and other project can use ns2 without any overlap and authentication problems.

---
#### 6.Three different types of services in Kubernetes: cluster IP mode, node Port mode, and load balancer mode.
- Cluster IP mode allows access to the service only within the Kubernetes cluster.
- Node Port mode enables access to the service using the Node IP and port number defined in the service.yaml file.
- When a service is created a NodePort type, The kube-proxy updates the IPTables with Node IP address and port that is chosen in the service configuration to access the pods.
- Where as if you create a Service as type Load Balancer, the cloud control manager creates a external load balancer IP using the underlying cloud provider logic in the C-CM.

- Users can access services using the external IP

####  7.What is the role of kube proxy?

- Kube-proxy works by maintaining a set of network rules on each node in the cluster, which are updated dynamically as services are added or removed. When a client sends a request to a service, the request is intercepted by kube-proxy on the node where it was received. Kube-proxy then looks up the destination endpoint for the service and routes the request accordingly.

- Kube-proxy is an essential component of a Kubernetes cluster, as it ensures that services can communicate with each other.
---
#### 8. What is the role of Kubelet?
- Kubelet manages the containers that are scheduled to run on that node. It ensures that the containers are running and healthy, and that the resources they need are available.

- Kubelet communicates with the Kubernetes API server to get information about the containers that should be running on the node, and then starts and stops the containers as needed to maintain the desired state. It also monitors the containers to ensure that they are running correctly, and restarts them if necessary..
---
#### 9.Day-to-day activities on Kubernetes
- We manage Kubernetes clusters and ensure application deployment with monitoring.
- We troubleshoot issues related to pods, services, and routing traffic. We also perform maintenance activities for worker nodes.

#### 19. How do you handle secret management in Kubernetes? Compare using Secrets vs. external secret management tools.
Kubernetes Secrets: Store sensitive information within the cluster, easy to use with native Kubernetes integration.
External Secret Management Tools: Use tools like HashiCorp Vault for enhanced security features, centralized secret management, and better audit capabilities.

#### 20. What strategies do you use for disaster recovery in a Kubernetes environment?
Backup: Regularly back up ETCD, application data, and configuration.
Redundancy: Use multi-zone and multi-region clusters.
Recovery: Have documented recovery procedures, automate the restoration process, and regularly test disaster recovery plans.

### 1. Explain the deployment manifest file?
Answer: A deployment manifest file in Kubernetes is a YAML file that defines the desired state for a set of pods, including the container image, replicas, labels, and other configurations. It describes how to create and update the deployment of applications within the cluster.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
Scenario: I used a deployment manifest file to automate the deployment of a web application, ensuring the desired number of replicas were maintained and updates were rolled out seamlessly.

### 2. Choreography vs Orchestration in Kubernetes?
Answer:
Choreography: Refers to the decentralized control where each microservice is responsible for its own behavior and interactions. Itâ€™s more about services being aware of each other and coordinating actions.
Orchestration: Involves a central control mechanism that coordinates and manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of microservices. Kubernetes orchestration involves managing pods, services, and deployments centrally.
Scenario: In Kubernetes, orchestration is achieved through controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets, which handle the lifecycle of pods and services, whereas choreography might involve services communicating through messaging systems or APIs.

### 3. What is the difference between stateless and stateful microservices?
Answer:
Stateless Microservices: Do not retain any state between requests. Each request is independent, and state is managed externally (e.g., in a database). This makes scaling and fault tolerance easier.
Stateful Microservices: Maintain state information across requests. They rely on persistent storage for state management, which can complicate scaling and require more careful handling of failures.
Scenario: I worked on a project where stateless microservices were used for the API layer, while stateful services managed user sessions and data persistence.

### 4. What is the role of domain events in microservices?
Answer: Domain events represent changes or actions in a domain that other services may be interested in. They are used to decouple microservices by allowing one service to publish events that other services can subscribe to and act upon.
Scenario: In a shopping application, an order placed event could trigger inventory updates and payment processing in separate microservices, ensuring they remain in sync without tight coupling.

### 5. How are the pods communicating with each other?
Answer: Pods in Kubernetes communicate with each other through:
ClusterIP Service: Provides a stable internal IP address for pods to communicate.
DNS: Kubernetes automatically assigns DNS names to services, allowing pods to communicate using service names.
Network Policies: Control traffic flow between pods based on labels and selectors.
Scenario: I set up a ClusterIP service to allow microservices running in different pods to communicate securely within the Kubernetes cluster.

### 6. What is Pod Security Policy?
Answer: Pod Security Policy (PSP) is a Kubernetes resource that controls the security settings of pods. It defines what security configurations are allowed for pod creation and execution, such as privilege escalation, volume types, and host networking.
Scenario: I used PSPs to enforce security standards across all pods, ensuring that only pods meeting specific security criteria were allowed to run in the cluster.

### 7. What is the Blue/Green Deployment Pattern?
Answer: The Blue/Green Deployment Pattern involves having two environments (Blue and Green). The Blue environment is the currently running version of the application, while the Green environment is the new version. Traffic is switched from Blue to Green once the new version is verified, ensuring zero downtime and easy rollback if issues arise.
Scenario: I used the Blue/Green deployment strategy to upgrade a web application, minimizing downtime and allowing for quick rollbacks if needed.

### 8. How do you secure microservices?
Answer:
Authentication and Authorization: Use mechanisms like OAuth2 and JWT to secure service-to-service communication.
Network Policies: Restrict communication between services using Kubernetes Network Policies.
Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
Service Mesh: Implement service meshes like Istio for advanced security features like mTLS and access control.
Scenario: I implemented JWT-based authentication and used Istio to enforce mutual TLS for secure communication between microservices.

### 9. What is a Service in Kubernetes? How many types are there?
Answer: A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy to access them. It provides a stable network identity for pods and load balancing.
Types of Services:
ClusterIP: Default service type; exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP.
NodePort: Exposes the service on each nodeâ€™s IP at a static port.
LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud providerâ€™s load balancer.
ExternalName: Maps the service to an external DNS name.
Scenario: I used a LoadBalancer service type to expose a web application to the internet, providing high availability and scalability.

### 10. How does Ingress help in Kubernetes?
Answer: Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It provides load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.
Scenario: I used Ingress to route traffic to different services based on URL paths and configured SSL termination for secure access.

### 11. What is API versioning and why is it important in microservices?
Answer: API versioning involves creating different versions of an API to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility. It allows services to evolve without breaking existing clients.
Importance:
Backward Compatibility: Ensures old clients continue to function while new features are introduced.
Controlled Rollout: Allows gradual migration to new versions.
Scenario: I implemented API versioning in a microservices architecture to support multiple versions of an API while transitioning to a new version.

### 12. What are taints and tolerations in Kubernetes and how do they work?
Answer:
Taints: Applied to nodes to repel pods from being scheduled on them unless the pod has a matching toleration. They are used to dedicate nodes for specific workloads or to prevent undesired scheduling.
Tolerations: Applied to pods to allow them to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints. They provide a way to tolerate node-specific conditions.
Scenario: I used taints to dedicate certain nodes for high-priority jobs and applied corresponding tolerations to those jobs to ensure they were scheduled correctly.

### 13. Handling Increased Traffic on Kubernetes Cluster?
Answer:
Auto Scaling: Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically adjust the number of pod replicas based on CPU or memory usage.
Cluster Autoscaler: Automatically adjust the number of nodes in the cluster based on resource requirements.
Load Balancing: Use Services and Ingress to distribute traffic evenly across pods.
Scenario: I set up HPA to handle increased traffic by scaling out pods and used Cluster Autoscaler to add nodes to the cluster as needed.

### 14. What are some common issues you might encounter when spinning up a container in Kubernetes?
Answer:
Image Pull Failures: Incorrect image name or inaccessible container registry.
Resource Limits: Insufficient CPU or memory leading to pod failures.
Configuration Errors: Misconfigured environment variables or secrets.
Networking Issues: Problems with service discovery or network policies.
Scenario: I encountered image pull failures due to incorrect image tags and resolved them by updating the deployment configuration with the correct image name.

### 15. Comprehensive Backup Strategy for Kubernetes?
Answer:
Persistent Volume Snapshots: Regularly take snapshots of persistent volumes to back up critical data.
Configuration Backup: Backup Kubernetes configuration, including deployments, services, and config maps.
Stateful Applications: Use application-specific backup tools or mechanisms for stateful applications (e.g., databases).
Disaster Recovery Plan: Implement a disaster recovery plan to restore the entire cluster or specific components.
Scenario: I implemented persistent volume snapshots and backed up critical Kubernetes configurations to ensure quick recovery in case of failures.

#### What is a StatefulSet, and when would you use it?
A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes resource for managing stateful applications. Unlike Deployments, which handle stateless applications, StatefulSets maintain a sticky identity for each pod, which includes a stable, unique network identifier and persistent storage. This is crucial for applications that require stable network identities or persistent storage, such as databases and distributed systems.
Explain the concept of Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC).
Persistent Volumes (PV): PVs are storage resources in a Kubernetes cluster that have been provisioned by an administrator. They are independent of individual pods and provide a way to manage and abstract storage.
Persistent Volume Claims (PVC): PVCs are requests for storage by users. They specify the amount of storage needed and any specific requirements. The Kubernetes control plane matches PVCs with available PVs and binds them, allowing pods to use the requested storage.


#### How does the Kubernetes scheduler work?
The Kubernetes scheduler is responsible for assigning pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints. It evaluates nodes for resource requirements (CPU, memory), affinity/anti-affinity rules, taints/tolerations, and other constraints. The scheduler then selects the most suitable node and schedules the pod to run on it.


#### What is a DaemonSet, and how is it used?
A DaemonSet ensures that a specific pod runs on all (or some) nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. It is typically used for running background services that need to be present on every node, such as log collectors, monitoring agents, or network plugins.


#### Describe the purpose and use of a Kubernetes Ingress.
A Kubernetes Ingress manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP/HTTPS. It provides routing rules to direct incoming traffic to the appropriate services based on hostnames and paths. Ingress controllers implement these rules and manage traffic routing.


#### How do you monitor a Kubernetes cluster?
Monitoring a Kubernetes cluster involves using tools and services to track the health and performance of the cluster and its components. Common approaches include:
Prometheus: For collecting and querying metrics.
Grafana: For visualizing metrics collected by Prometheus.
ELK Stack: For centralized logging and search capabilities.
Kubernetes Dashboard: For a web-based UI to monitor cluster status.


#### What is Helm, and how does it simplify Kubernetes management?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. It uses Helm charts, which are pre-configured templates for Kubernetes resources. Helm charts streamline the installation, upgrade, and rollback of applications by providing a consistent and reusable way to define and deploy resources.


#### Explain the use of Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets.
ConfigMaps: ConfigMaps are used to store non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pairs. They provide a way to separate configuration from application code and allow dynamic configuration updates.
Secrets: Secrets are used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, and keys. They are encoded and stored securely, and access can be restricted to authorized pods and users.


#### What are Kubernetes Operators, and how do they work?
Kubernetes Operators are a method of extending Kubernetes to manage complex applications. They use custom resources and controllers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of stateful applications. Operators encapsulate the knowledge and operational procedures of application management into code, enabling Kubernetes to manage these applications as a native resource.


#### How do you handle logging in a Kubernetes environment?
Logging in a Kubernetes environment typically involves:
Centralized Logging: Using tools like Fluentd, Logstash, or the ELK Stack to collect and aggregate logs from all pods and nodes.
Cloud Provider Solutions: Utilizing services like AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, or Azure Monitor for log management.
Sidecar Containers: Deploying sidecar containers alongside your application pods to handle log collection and forwarding.


#### What is the purpose of taints and tolerations in Kubernetes?
Taints: Taints are applied to nodes to prevent pods from being scheduled on them unless the pods can tolerate the taint. This is useful for dedicating nodes for specific workloads or preventing non-critical workloads from running on nodes with special requirements.
Tolerations: Tolerations are applied to pods to allow them to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints. They ensure that pods can be scheduled on nodes with specific conditions.


#### How do you secure a Kubernetes cluster?
Securing a Kubernetes cluster involves multiple strategies:
RBAC: Implement Role-Based Access Control to manage permissions.
Network Policies: Define rules to control traffic between pods.
Pod Security Policies: Enforce security configurations for pod containers.
Secrets Management: Use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data.
API Server Security: Secure the API server with authentication and authorization.
Regular Updates: Keep Kubernetes and its components up to date with the latest security patches.


#### What is a Kubernetes Job, and how does it differ from a Deployment?
A Kubernetes Job is used for running one or more pods to completion, typically for batch processing or tasks that need to run to a defined end state. Jobs ensure that a specified number of pods successfully complete their work.
A Deployment, on the other hand, manages the lifecycle of stateless applications, ensuring that a specified number of pod replicas are running and available at all times. Deployments are used for continuous services rather than batch jobs.


#### Explain the concept of Kubernetes Network Policies.
Kubernetes Network Policies define rules to control the traffic between pods within a cluster. They specify which pods can communicate with each other based on labels, namespaces, and IP addresses. Network Policies help enforce security and segmentation within a Kubernetes network.


#### How do you troubleshoot a failing Pod in Kubernetes?
Troubleshooting a failing Pod involves several steps:
Check Pod Status: Use kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to get detailed information about the pod and its events.
View Logs: Use kubectl logs <pod-name> to view container logs for error messages.
Inspect Events: Look for any related events using kubectl get events to identify issues.
Check Resource Usage: Ensure that the pod has adequate resources (CPU, memory) by examining the resource usage.
Verify Configuration: Check that environment variables, ConfigMaps, and Secrets are correctly configured.
Debug Containers: Use kubectl exec to access the container and debug issues interactively.
