# Kubernetes

#### 24. What are nodes in Kubernetes?
Answer: Nodes in Kubernetes are the worker machines that run containerized applications. Each node contains the necessary components to run Pods, including the container runtime, kubelet (agent that manages containers), and kube-proxy (handles network communication). Nodes can be physical or virtual machines and are managed by the Kubernetes control plane.
#### 25. What is a Pod in Kubernetes?
Answer: A Pod is the smallest and simplest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It is a group of one or more containers that share the same network namespace, IP address, and storage. Pods are used to deploy applications and manage containerized workloads, and they enable containers within the same Pod to communicate with each other using localhost.
#### 26. What are Services in Kubernetes?
Answer: Services in Kubernetes provide a stable network endpoint for accessing a set of Pods. They abstract the underlying Pods and allow for load balancing and service discovery. Types of Services include:
ClusterIP: Accessible only within the Kubernetes cluster.
NodePort: Accessible externally via a port on each node.
LoadBalancer: Provisioned with an external load balancer for access outside the cluster.
ExternalName: Maps the Service to an external DNS name.
#### 27. How does a Load Balancer work in Kubernetes?
Answer: In Kubernetes, a Load Balancer Service type provisions an external load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across multiple Pods. When a Service of type LoadBalancer is created, Kubernetes integrates with the cloud provider to set up a load balancer, which then routes traffic to the Pods associated with the Service. This ensures high availability and fault tolerance for applications.
#### 28. Explain Blue-Green Deployment.
Answer: Blue-Green Deployment is a strategy for minimizing downtime and reducing risk during application releases. Two environments, blue and green, are maintained. The blue environment is the current live production environment, while the green environment is where the new version of the application is deployed. After the new version is tested in the green environment, traffic is switched from blue to green. If any issues arise, the switch can be easily reversed to the blue environment.


#### 3. Have you upgraded any Kubernetes clusters?
Answer: Yes, I have experience upgrading Kubernetes clusters. The upgrade process usually involves upgrading the control plane components (like kube-apiserver, etcd, etc.) followed by the worker nodes. The specific steps depend on the managed Kubernetes service (e.g., EKS, AKS, or GKE) or if it's a self-managed cluster.
Scenario: In a previous role, I upgraded an EKS cluster from version 1.18 to 1.20. The upgrade was planned during a maintenance window to minimize disruption. I first upgraded the control plane through the AWS Management Console and then incrementally upgraded the worker nodes by draining and replacing them.

#### 4. How do you deploy an application in a Kubernetes cluster?
Answer: Deploying an application in a Kubernetes cluster typically involves creating and applying YAML manifests for resources like Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets. The kubectl apply -f <filename> command is used to apply these configurations.
Scenario: In a project, I deployed a microservices application to a Kubernetes cluster by creating Deployment and Service YAML files for each service. I stored these files in a Git repository and used Jenkins to automate the deployment process through a CI/CD pipeline.

#### 5. How do you communicate with a Jenkins server and a Kubernetes cluster?
Answer: To communicate between Jenkins and a Kubernetes cluster, I use the Kubernetes plugin in Jenkins. This plugin allows Jenkins to dynamically launch Kubernetes pods as Jenkins agents to execute CI/CD jobs.
Scenario: I configured Jenkins to deploy applications to a Kubernetes cluster. Jenkins used a kubeconfig file with appropriate RBAC permissions to interact with the cluster. This allowed Jenkins to execute kubectl commands and deploy updates during the CI/CD pipeline.
#### 7. **Explain Kubernetes and its role in container orchestration.**
   - Answer: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides features such as load balancing, automatic rollouts and rollbacks, and self-healing of applications.



#### 9. **Describe your experience with Kubernetes deployments. How do you manage configurations and scale applications?**
   - Answer: I manage Kubernetes deployments using YAML manifests or Helm charts. I define Deployments for application lifecycle management, ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management, and Horizontal Pod Autoscalers for automatic scaling based on resource usage metrics.
#### 4. **How do you ensure security in Docker containers and Kubernetes deployments?**
   - Answer: "I ensure container security by adhering to best practices such as using minimal base images, regularly updating images and dependencies, and implementing least privilege principles. In Kubernetes, I configure Pod Security Policies, network policies, and secrets management to enhance security posture."

#### 5. **Explain the process of deploying a microservices-based application using Docker and managing it with Kubernetes.**
   - Answer: "I containerize individual microservices using Docker, ensuring each service is isolated and scalable. In Kubernetes, I define Deployments and Services to manage application lifecycle and expose services internally or externally. I use Helm for package management and manage configurations using ConfigMaps and Secrets."


#### 1. Difference between Docker and Kubernetes
- Docker is a container platform while Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform.
- Kubernetes offers features like auto healing, auto scaling, cluster management, and enterprise capabilities.
  
---
#### 2.Cloud Control Manager in Kubernetes
- On a broad level, you can divide the kubernetes components in two parts

1. Control Plane (API SERVER, SCHEDULER, Controller Manager, C-CM, ETCD)

2. Data Plane (Kubelet, Kube-proxy, Container Runtime)
---
#### 3. What are the main differences between the Docker Swarm and Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes is better suited for large organisations as it offers more scalability, networking capabilities like policies and huge third party ecosystem 
---
#### 4.Difference between Docker container and Kubernetes pod
- A pod is a runtime specification in Kubernetes written in YAML files
- A pod can have one or multiple containers that can communicate using the same network and share resources
---
#### 5.What is a namespace in Kubernetes ?

- In Kubernetes namespace is a logical isolation of resources, network policies, rbac and everything. For example, there are two projects using same k8s cluster. One project can use ns1 and other project can use ns2 without any overlap and authentication problems.

---
#### 6.Three different types of services in Kubernetes: cluster IP mode, node Port mode, and load balancer mode.
- Cluster IP mode allows access to the service only within the Kubernetes cluster.
- Node Port mode enables access to the service using the Node IP and port number defined in the service.yaml file.
- When a service is created a NodePort type, The kube-proxy updates the IPTables with Node IP address and port that is chosen in the service configuration to access the pods.
- Where as if you create a Service as type Load Balancer, the cloud control manager creates a external load balancer IP using the underlying cloud provider logic in the C-CM.

- Users can access services using the external IP

####  7.What is the role of kube proxy?

- Kube-proxy works by maintaining a set of network rules on each node in the cluster, which are updated dynamically as services are added or removed. When a client sends a request to a service, the request is intercepted by kube-proxy on the node where it was received. Kube-proxy then looks up the destination endpoint for the service and routes the request accordingly.

- Kube-proxy is an essential component of a Kubernetes cluster, as it ensures that services can communicate with each other.
---
#### 8. What is the role of Kubelet?
- Kubelet manages the containers that are scheduled to run on that node. It ensures that the containers are running and healthy, and that the resources they need are available.

- Kubelet communicates with the Kubernetes API server to get information about the containers that should be running on the node, and then starts and stops the containers as needed to maintain the desired state. It also monitors the containers to ensure that they are running correctly, and restarts them if necessary..
---
#### 9.Day-to-day activities on Kubernetes
- We manage Kubernetes clusters and ensure application deployment with monitoring.
- We troubleshoot issues related to pods, services, and routing traffic. We also perform maintenance activities for worker nodes.

Backup: Regularly back up ETCD, application data, and configuration.
Redundancy: Use multi-zone and multi-region clusters.
Recovery: Have documented recovery procedures, automate the restoration process, and regularly test disaster recovery plans.

### 1. Explain the deployment manifest file?
Answer: A deployment manifest file in Kubernetes is a YAML file that defines the desired state for a set of pods, including the container image, replicas, labels, and other configurations. It describes how to create and update the deployment of applications within the cluster.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
Scenario: I used a deployment manifest file to automate the deployment of a web application, ensuring the desired number of replicas were maintained and updates were rolled out seamlessly.

### 2. Choreography vs Orchestration in Kubernetes?
Answer:
Choreography: Refers to the decentralized control where each microservice is responsible for its own behavior and interactions. It’s more about services being aware of each other and coordinating actions.
Orchestration: Involves a central control mechanism that coordinates and manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of microservices. Kubernetes orchestration involves managing pods, services, and deployments centrally.
Scenario: In Kubernetes, orchestration is achieved through controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets, which handle the lifecycle of pods and services, whereas choreography might involve services communicating through messaging systems or APIs.

### 3. What is the difference between stateless and stateful microservices?
Answer:
Stateless Microservices: Do not retain any state between requests. Each request is independent, and state is managed externally (e.g., in a database). This makes scaling and fault tolerance easier.
Stateful Microservices: Maintain state information across requests. They rely on persistent storage for state management, which can complicate scaling and require more careful handling of failures.
Scenario: I worked on a project where stateless microservices were used for the API layer, while stateful services managed user sessions and data persistence.

### 4. What is the role of domain events in microservices?
Answer: Domain events represent changes or actions in a domain that other services may be interested in. They are used to decouple microservices by allowing one service to publish events that other services can subscribe to and act upon.
Scenario: In a shopping application, an order placed event could trigger inventory updates and payment processing in separate microservices, ensuring they remain in sync without tight coupling.

### 5. How are the pods communicating with each other?
Answer: Pods in Kubernetes communicate with each other through:
ClusterIP Service: Provides a stable internal IP address for pods to communicate.
DNS: Kubernetes automatically assigns DNS names to services, allowing pods to communicate using service names.
Network Policies: Control traffic flow between pods based on labels and selectors.
Scenario: I set up a ClusterIP service to allow microservices running in different pods to communicate securely within the Kubernetes cluster.

### 6. What is Pod Security Policy?
Answer: Pod Security Policy (PSP) is a Kubernetes resource that controls the security settings of pods. It defines what security configurations are allowed for pod creation and execution, such as privilege escalation, volume types, and host networking.
Scenario: I used PSPs to enforce security standards across all pods, ensuring that only pods meeting specific security criteria were allowed to run in the cluster.

### 7. What is the Blue/Green Deployment Pattern?
Answer: The Blue/Green Deployment Pattern involves having two environments (Blue and Green). The Blue environment is the currently running version of the application, while the Green environment is the new version. Traffic is switched from Blue to Green once the new version is verified, ensuring zero downtime and easy rollback if issues arise.
Scenario: I used the Blue/Green deployment strategy to upgrade a web application, minimizing downtime and allowing for quick rollbacks if needed.

### 8. How do you secure microservices?
Answer:
Authentication and Authorization: Use mechanisms like OAuth2 and JWT to secure service-to-service communication.
Network Policies: Restrict communication between services using Kubernetes Network Policies.
Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
Service Mesh: Implement service meshes like Istio for advanced security features like mTLS and access control.
Scenario: I implemented JWT-based authentication and used Istio to enforce mutual TLS for secure communication between microservices.

### 9. What is a Service in Kubernetes? How many types are there?
Answer: A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy to access them. It provides a stable network identity for pods and load balancing.
Types of Services:
ClusterIP: Default service type; exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP.
NodePort: Exposes the service on each node’s IP at a static port.
LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.
ExternalName: Maps the service to an external DNS name.
Scenario: I used a LoadBalancer service type to expose a web application to the internet, providing high availability and scalability.

### 10. How does Ingress help in Kubernetes?
Answer: Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It provides load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.
Scenario: I used Ingress to route traffic to different services based on URL paths and configured SSL termination for secure access.

### 11. What is API versioning and why is it important in microservices?
Answer: API versioning involves creating different versions of an API to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility. It allows services to evolve without breaking existing clients.
Importance:
Backward Compatibility: Ensures old clients continue to function while new features are introduced.
Controlled Rollout: Allows gradual migration to new versions.
Scenario: I implemented API versioning in a microservices architecture to support multiple versions of an API while transitioning to a new version.

### 12. What are taints and tolerations in Kubernetes and how do they work?
Answer:
Taints: Applied to nodes to repel pods from being scheduled on them unless the pod has a matching toleration. They are used to dedicate nodes for specific workloads or to prevent undesired scheduling.
Tolerations: Applied to pods to allow them to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints. They provide a way to tolerate node-specific conditions.
Scenario: I used taints to dedicate certain nodes for high-priority jobs and applied corresponding tolerations to those jobs to ensure they were scheduled correctly.

### 13. Handling Increased Traffic on Kubernetes Cluster?
Answer:
Auto Scaling: Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically adjust the number of pod replicas based on CPU or memory usage.
Cluster Autoscaler: Automatically adjust the number of nodes in the cluster based on resource requirements.
Load Balancing: Use Services and Ingress to distribute traffic evenly across pods.
Scenario: I set up HPA to handle increased traffic by scaling out pods and used Cluster Autoscaler to add nodes to the cluster as needed.

### 14. What are some common issues you might encounter when spinning up a container in Kubernetes?
Answer:
Image Pull Failures: Incorrect image name or inaccessible container registry.
Resource Limits: Insufficient CPU or memory leading to pod failures.
Configuration Errors: Misconfigured environment variables or secrets.
Networking Issues: Problems with service discovery or network policies.
Scenario: I encountered image pull failures due to incorrect image tags and resolved them by updating the deployment configuration with the correct image name.

### 15. Comprehensive Backup Strategy for Kubernetes?
Answer:
Persistent Volume Snapshots: Regularly take snapshots of persistent volumes to back up critical data.
Configuration Backup: Backup Kubernetes configuration, including deployments, services, and config maps.
Stateful Applications: Use application-specific backup tools or mechanisms for stateful applications (e.g., databases).
Disaster Recovery Plan: Implement a disaster recovery plan to restore the entire cluster or specific components.
Scenario: I implemented persistent volume snapshots and backed up critical Kubernetes configurations to ensure quick recovery in case of failures.

#### What is a StatefulSet, and when would you use it?
A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes resource for managing stateful applications. Unlike Deployments, which handle stateless applications, StatefulSets maintain a sticky identity for each pod, which includes a stable, unique network identifier and persistent storage. This is crucial for applications that require stable network identities or persistent storage, such as databases and distributed systems.
Explain the concept of Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC).
Persistent Volumes (PV): PVs are storage resources in a Kubernetes cluster that have been provisioned by an administrator. They are independent of individual pods and provide a way to manage and abstract storage.
Persistent Volume Claims (PVC): PVCs are requests for storage by users. They specify the amount of storage needed and any specific requirements. The Kubernetes control plane matches PVCs with available PVs and binds them, allowing pods to use the requested storage.


#### How does the Kubernetes scheduler work?
The Kubernetes scheduler is responsible for assigning pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints. It evaluates nodes for resource requirements (CPU, memory), affinity/anti-affinity rules, taints/tolerations, and other constraints. The scheduler then selects the most suitable node and schedules the pod to run on it.


#### What is a DaemonSet, and how is it used?
A DaemonSet ensures that a specific pod runs on all (or some) nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. It is typically used for running background services that need to be present on every node, such as log collectors, monitoring agents, or network plugins.


#### Describe the purpose and use of a Kubernetes Ingress.
A Kubernetes Ingress manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP/HTTPS. It provides routing rules to direct incoming traffic to the appropriate services based on hostnames and paths. Ingress controllers implement these rules and manage traffic routing.


#### How do you monitor a Kubernetes cluster?
Monitoring a Kubernetes cluster involves using tools and services to track the health and performance of the cluster and its components. Common approaches include:
Prometheus: For collecting and querying metrics.
Grafana: For visualizing metrics collected by Prometheus.
ELK Stack: For centralized logging and search capabilities.
Kubernetes Dashboard: For a web-based UI to monitor cluster status.


#### What is Helm, and how does it simplify Kubernetes management?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. It uses Helm charts, which are pre-configured templates for Kubernetes resources. Helm charts streamline the installation, upgrade, and rollback of applications by providing a consistent and reusable way to define and deploy resources.


#### Explain the use of Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets.
ConfigMaps: ConfigMaps are used to store non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pairs. They provide a way to separate configuration from application code and allow dynamic configuration updates.
Secrets: Secrets are used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, and keys. They are encoded and stored securely, and access can be restricted to authorized pods and users.


#### What are Kubernetes Operators, and how do they work?
Kubernetes Operators are a method of extending Kubernetes to manage complex applications. They use custom resources and controllers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of stateful applications. Operators encapsulate the knowledge and operational procedures of application management into code, enabling Kubernetes to manage these applications as a native resource.


#### How do you handle logging in a Kubernetes environment?
Logging in a Kubernetes environment typically involves:
Centralized Logging: Using tools like Fluentd, Logstash, or the ELK Stack to collect and aggregate logs from all pods and nodes.
Cloud Provider Solutions: Utilizing services like AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, or Azure Monitor for log management.
Sidecar Containers: Deploying sidecar containers alongside your application pods to handle log collection and forwarding.


#### What is the purpose of taints and tolerations in Kubernetes?
Taints: Taints are applied to nodes to prevent pods from being scheduled on them unless the pods can tolerate the taint. This is useful for dedicating nodes for specific workloads or preventing non-critical workloads from running on nodes with special requirements.
Tolerations: Tolerations are applied to pods to allow them to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints. They ensure that pods can be scheduled on nodes with specific conditions.


#### How do you secure a Kubernetes cluster?
Securing a Kubernetes cluster involves multiple strategies:
RBAC: Implement Role-Based Access Control to manage permissions.
Network Policies: Define rules to control traffic between pods.
Pod Security Policies: Enforce security configurations for pod containers.
Secrets Management: Use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data.
API Server Security: Secure the API server with authentication and authorization.
Regular Updates: Keep Kubernetes and its components up to date with the latest security patches.


#### What is a Kubernetes Job, and how does it differ from a Deployment?
A Kubernetes Job is used for running one or more pods to completion, typically for batch processing or tasks that need to run to a defined end state. Jobs ensure that a specified number of pods successfully complete their work.
A Deployment, on the other hand, manages the lifecycle of stateless applications, ensuring that a specified number of pod replicas are running and available at all times. Deployments are used for continuous services rather than batch jobs.


#### Explain the concept of Kubernetes Network Policies.
Kubernetes Network Policies define rules to control the traffic between pods within a cluster. They specify which pods can communicate with each other based on labels, namespaces, and IP addresses. Network Policies help enforce security and segmentation within a Kubernetes network.


#### How do you troubleshoot a failing Pod in Kubernetes?
Troubleshooting a failing Pod involves several steps:
Check Pod Status: Use kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to get detailed information about the pod and its events.
View Logs: Use kubectl logs <pod-name> to view container logs for error messages.
Inspect Events: Look for any related events using kubectl get events to identify issues.
Check Resource Usage: Ensure that the pod has adequate resources (CPU, memory) by examining the resource usage.
Verify Configuration: Check that environment variables, ConfigMaps, and Secrets are correctly configured.
Debug Containers: Use kubectl exec to access the container and debug issues interactively.




#### 21. Have you upgraded any Kubernetes clusters?
Answer: Yes, I have upgraded Kubernetes clusters by following these steps:
Backup: Backup critical data and configurations.
Upgrade Control Plane: Upgrade the control plane components (e.g., kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler).
Upgrade Worker Nodes: Upgrade the kubelet and other components on the worker nodes.
Validate: Run tests to ensure the cluster is functioning correctly post-upgrade.
Scenario: In a project, I upgraded a Kubernetes cluster from version 1.17 to 1.18, ensuring minimal downtime by carefully planning and executing the upgrade in stages.

#### 22. How do you deploy an application in a Kubernetes cluster?
Answer: To deploy an application in Kubernetes:
Create Deployment YAML: Define a Deployment manifest specifying the container image, replicas, and other configurations.
Apply Deployment: Use kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml to deploy the application.
Expose Service: Create a Service to expose the deployment, either internally within the cluster or externally.
Monitor: Use kubectl get pods and kubectl logs to monitor the deployment.
Scenario: I deployed a microservice application using a Helm chart, allowing for easy management and updates of the application in the Kubernetes cluster.

#### 23. How do you communicate with a Jenkins server and a Kubernetes cluster?
Answer: Communication between Jenkins and a Kubernetes cluster can be established by:
Kubernetes Plugin: Use the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin to interact with the cluster.
Kubeconfig File: Provide the kubeconfig file to Jenkins to authenticate and manage the cluster.
Jenkins Pipeline: Define pipeline steps that use kubectl or Helm commands to deploy applications to the cluster.
Scenario: In a CI/CD pipeline, I configured Jenkins to deploy Docker images to a Kubernetes cluster by using the Kubernetes plugin and a service account with appropriate permissions.

#### 24. How do you generate Kubernetes cluster credentials?
Answer: Kubernetes cluster credentials can be generated by:
Kubeconfig: Downloading or generating the kubeconfig file from the cluster management tool (e.g., eksctl, GKE console).
Service Accounts: Creating a service account with a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding to assign permissions.
Scenario: For a project, I used eksctl to generate the kubeconfig for an EKS cluster and configured Jenkins with the necessary credentials to manage deployments.

# Helm
What is Helm?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you manage Kubernetes applications through easy-to-create packages called charts. It streamlines the installation, upgrading, and management of Kubernetes applications.

What are the advantages of Helm?
Reusability: Charts can be easily shared and reused.
Templating: Allows parameterization and templating of Kubernetes manifests.
Versioning: Supports versioning of application deployments.
Simplicity: Simplifies complex application deployments into a single command.
Ecosystem: Access to a wide range of charts from Helm Hub and other repositories.

Why use Helm?
Helm simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications by packaging them into reusable, versioned charts. It enhances productivity and consistency across environments.

What are Helm Charts?
Helm Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. They include YAML definitions for Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc., along with customizable templates and configuration values.

What is the Folder Structure of Helm Chart?
A typical Helm Chart folder structure includes:
bash
Copy code
mychart/
├── Chart.yaml         # Metadata about the chart
├── values.yaml        # Default configuration values
├── templates/         # Directory containing Kubernetes manifests (YAML templates)
├── charts/            # Directory containing dependencies (optional)
└── README.md          # Chart documentation


Which different types of fields need to be specified for dependencies in Helm Chart?
Dependencies in Helm Charts are specified in the requirements.yaml file, where you define charts that your chart depends on, along with their version constraints.

How can we create Helm Charts?
Helm Charts can be created using the helm create command, which generates a basic chart structure. You can then customize this structure to define your application's Kubernetes resources.

How does Helm work?
Helm works by deploying charts (packaged applications) into Kubernetes clusters. It uses a client-server architecture where the Helm client interacts with the Kubernetes API server to manage releases of charts.

What are the concepts used in Helm?
Helm uses concepts such as Charts (packaged applications), Releases (instances of charts deployed in Kubernetes), Repositories (storage for Helm charts), and Values (configuration parameters for charts).

How can we install a specific Chart version in Helm?
To install a specific version of a chart, use:helm install myrelease repo_name/chart_name --version 1.2.3
How can we set multiple values with Helm?
Multiple values can be set using a YAML file or by passing individual --set parameters during chart installation or upgrade:
helm install myrelease repo_name/chart_name --set key1=value1 --set key2=value2

How does Helm update Kubernetes?
Helm updates Kubernetes by managing deployments and updates of applications packaged as Helm charts. It applies Kubernetes manifests defined in charts to the Kubernetes cluster.

How do we list all the available charts under a Helm Repo?
Use the command helm search repo to list all available charts in a Helm repository.

How do we validate Helm Chart content?
Helm charts can be validated using helm lint, which checks the chart’s structure, metadata, and Kubernetes manifests for correctness.

How can we uninstall Helm Chart on specific resources?
To uninstall a Helm release (chart):helm uninstall myrelease
Does Helm still use Tiller?
No, Helm v3 does not use Tiller. Tiller was removed in Helm v3 for security and simplicity reasons.

What is replicaCount in Helm?
replicaCount in Helm charts specifies the number of replicas (instances) of a Kubernetes Deployment or StatefulSet that should be created and maintained.

What is _helpers.tpl in Helm?
_helpers.tpl is a special file in Helm charts where reusable template helpers (functions) are defined using Go's text/template and spring functions. These helpers can simplify template logic and make charts more maintainable.

Can a Helm chart have multiple deployments?
Yes, a Helm chart can define multiple Kubernetes deployments (or other resources) in the templates/ directory. Each deployment is typically encapsulated in its own YAML manifest file.

Where do you store Helm charts?
Helm charts can be stored in local directories or published to Helm repositories (like Helm Hub or your own repository).

Where are Helm repos stored locally?
Helm repositories are stored locally in the ~/.helm/repository/ directory by default.

What is Helm values.yaml?
values.yaml is a file in Helm charts where default configuration values for the chart are defined. Users can override these values during chart installation or upgrade.

What is Helm Kubernetes?
Helm Kubernetes refers to the integration of Helm with Kubernetes. Helm manages Kubernetes applications (deployments, services, etc.) by packaging them as charts and deploying them onto Kubernetes clusters.

What is Helm DevOps?
Helm DevOps refers to the use of Helm in DevOps practices for automating deployment, scaling, and management of Kubernetes applications. It enhances collaboration and repeatability in deploying cloud-native applications.

Who invented Helm?
Helm was initially developed by Deis (now part of Microsoft) and later contributed to the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation).

What are the benefits of Helm?
Benefits of Helm include simplifying Kubernetes application deployment, enabling versioned releases, enhancing reusability of application configurations, and providing a templating mechanism for Kubernetes manifests.

Is Helm open source?
Yes, Helm is an open-source project maintained by the CNCF. It is available under the Apache License 2.0.

What is Helm deployment?

What is Helm Hub?
Helm Hub is the official Helm chart repository where users can find, share, and deploy Helm charts for various Kubernetes applications.

What is a Helm artifact?
In the context of Helm, an artifact refers to a packaged Helm chart file (.tgz file) that contains all the necessary Kubernetes manifests and configuration files for deploying an application onto Kubernetes.

What is the Helm chart used for?
Helm charts are used for packaging, distributing, and managing Kubernetes applications. They provide an easy way to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications and their dependencies.

How do you push a Helm chart?
To push a Helm chart to a repository, you can use the helm push command (though it's not part of core Helm and may require additional plugins or repositories).

What is the Umbrella chart in Helm?
An Umbrella chart in Helm is a special type of chart that encapsulates multiple Helm subcharts. It allows deploying and managing multiple related applications or microservices as a single unit.

How does Helm upgrade work?
helm upgrade command updates an existing Helm release (chart) by applying changes to the Kubernetes resources defined in the chart. It can update container images, configuration values, and other aspects of the deployed application.

Does Helm have an API?
Helm itself does not have a REST API, but it provides a CLI and client libraries (like Helm SDK) that interact with Kubernetes API server for managing deployments.

What is Helm init?
helm init was a command in Helm v2 used to initialize Helm and install Tiller (the Helm server-side component) into Kubernetes cluster. In Helm v3, Tiller is no longer used, so helm init is unnecessary.

What is values.yaml in Helm?
values.yaml is a YAML file used in Helm charts to define default configuration values for the chart. Users can override these values during installation or upgrade using --set flags or a separate YAML file.

What is fullname in Helm?
fullname in Helm refers to the fully-qualified name of a release instance (or deployment) of a Helm chart. It combines the release name and the namespace to uniquely identify the deployment in Kubernetes.

What is Helm value?
In Helm, a value refers to a configuration parameter or setting that can be customized during the installation or upgrade of a Helm chart. Values are typically defined in values.yaml or provided using --set flags.

What is fullname in Helm?
fullname in Helm refers to the fully-qualified name of a release instance of a Helm chart. It is constructed using the release name and the namespace where the release is deployed. For example, if you deploy a Helm chart with release name myapp in namespace default, the fullname might be myapp-default.

What is Helm value?
In Helm, a value refers to a configuration parameter or setting that can be customized during the installation or upgrade of a Helm chart. Values are typically defined in values.yaml or provided using --set flags during chart installation.
