Introduction:

Good [morning/afternoon], it's my pleasure to introduce myself. My name is Pratiksha Ravindra Zende, and I am a dedicated Cloud and DevOps Engineer with over 2.6 years of experience. My journey in technology began during my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Savitribai Phule Pune University, where I developed a strong foundation in programming, system administration, and cloud computing.
Professional Background:
My career took off at Webtouch Software Development Pvt Ltd, where I work as a DevOps and Cloud Engineer. Over the past few years, I’ve had the privilege to work on complex and impactful projects for several clients. These projects provided me with invaluable experience in cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline management, automation, and security.
Technical Expertise:
A significant portion of my work revolves around cloud platforms, particularly AWS and Azure. I have a deep understanding of various AWS services, including EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, and Lambda, which I’ve used to optimize application performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency. My expertise also extends to Terraform, a tool I frequently use for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), enabling consistent and automated cloud resource management.
In addition to cloud platforms, I am proficient in CI/CD tools like Jenkins and Azure DevOps. I’ve designed and implemented pipelines that have significantly streamlined our development and deployment processes, reducing manual errors and accelerating delivery timelines. My experience with containerization using Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes has allowed me to efficiently manage application life cycles, ensuring that our deployments are consistent across different environments.
Key Projects:
I worked on One of the bank projects, where I was tasked with enhancing their security practices within their CI/CD pipelines. I implemented a DevSecOps pipeline using Jenkins, integrating security checks throughout the development process. This not only improved the security of their applications but also ensured that the development team could continue to work efficiently without being bogged down by manual security audits.
Another project for Cisco involved optimizing their cloud infrastructure across AWS. I utilized Terraform to automate the provisioning and scaling of resources, which significantly reduced manual intervention and ensured that the infrastructure was always in line with best practices. Additionally, I automated several infrastructure tasks using Ansible, such as environment configuration, user management, and continuous deployment, which helped standardize processes and improve overall efficiency.
Skill set and Strengths:
My technical skillset includes source code management with Git and GitHub, configuration management with Ansible, and scripting in Bash and Shell. I have a solid background in Linux systems administration, which has been crucial in managing the environments in which our applications run.
One of my key strengths is my ability to troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly. Whether it's addressing deployment errors, optimizing cloud resources, or resolving security vulnerabilities, I have a proven track record of tackling challenges head-on and finding effective solutions. I am also highly collaborative, often working closely with cross-functional teams to ensure that our goals are aligned and that we are all moving in the same direction.

#### 1. Suppose you are working alone; how do you handle a P1 or critical issue?
Answer:
When dealing with a P1 issue, my first step is to quickly assess the situation by checking monitoring systems and alerts. I prioritize identifying the root cause and work on a rollback plan or a temporary fix if necessary. I communicate the issue and progress transparently to the relevant stakeholders, ensuring they are updated at regular intervals. Once the issue is under control, I focus on implementing a permanent solution and documenting the incident to prevent future occurrences.
#### 2. Suppose you are working alone and receive two critical P1 issues simultaneously. How do you handle it?
Answer:
In such cases, I first assess the impact and severity of both issues, prioritizing the one affecting business-critical systems. While addressing the first issue, I ensure the second one is acknowledged and communicate the delay to relevant stakeholders. If the second issue requires immediate attention, I either delegate to a backup team or automate a quick containment strategy (like re-routing traffic) while focusing on the highest priority. Clear communication is essential here to manage expectations while multitasking effectively.
#### 3. How do you handle work pressure?
Answer:
I handle work pressure by staying organized, prioritizing tasks based on their urgency and impact, and breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones.

Stress management techniques like deep breathing or stepping away briefly also help me stay sharp and productive.
#### 4. How do you manage work issues and conflict?
Answer:
To manage conflicts, I first ensure open and clear communication to understand each person's perspective. I believe in addressing conflicts early before they escalate, encouraging a collaborative approach to problem-solving. I remain neutral, listen to all sides, and work on finding a compromise that meets the team’s objectives while fostering respect. If necessary, I escalate the issue to management while ensuring it doesn't impact the team’s overall performance.
#### 5. Suppose you have a deadline and need to work extra time. How do you manage that?
Answer:
If a deadline is approaching and extra work is required, I first evaluate the task's scope and prioritize the most critical aspects. I am open to working longer hours but ensure that I pace myself to avoid burnout. Proper time management, such as setting milestones and focusing on high-impact activities, helps me meet deadlines efficiently. If needed, I communicate with stakeholders about the extra effort required and align on any possible deadline extensions.
#### 6. What strategies can you employ to meet deadlines?
Answer:
Clear Task Prioritization: Break down tasks and prioritize based on impact and urgency.
Regular Progress Monitoring: Use tools like Kanban boards or sprint trackers to monitor progress and adjust as needed.

Anticipate Risks: Have contingency plans for possible setbacks and adjust schedules accordingly.
#### 7. How do you collaborate with a team?
Answer:
I collaborate by encouraging open communication and ensuring everyone understands their roles and responsibilities. I use tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams for regular check-ins and use project management tools like Jira or Trello for task tracking. I foster an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas and challenges. I also lead by example, offering support, sharing feedback, and actively listening to others’ suggestions, ensuring we all work towards the same goal.
