Introduction:

Good [morning/afternoon], it's my pleasure to introduce myself. My name is Pratiksha Ravindra Zende, and I am a dedicated Cloud and DevOps Engineer with over 2.6 years of experience. My journey in technology began during my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Savitribai Phule Pune University, where I developed a strong foundation in programming, system administration, and cloud computing.
Professional Background:
My career took off at Webtouch Software Development Pvt Ltd, where I work as a DevOps and Cloud Engineer. Over the past few years, I’ve had the privilege to work on complex and impactful projects for several clients. These projects provided me with invaluable experience in cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline management, automation, and security.
Technical Expertise:
A significant portion of my work revolves around cloud platforms, particularly AWS and Azure. I have a deep understanding of various AWS services, including EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, and Lambda, which I’ve used to optimize application performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency. My expertise also extends to Terraform, a tool I frequently use for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), enabling consistent and automated cloud resource management.
In addition to cloud platforms, I am proficient in CI/CD tools like Jenkins and Azure DevOps. I’ve designed and implemented pipelines that have significantly streamlined our development and deployment processes, reducing manual errors and accelerating delivery timelines. My experience with containerization using Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes has allowed me to efficiently manage application life cycles, ensuring that our deployments are consistent across different environments.
Key Projects:
I worked on One of the bank projects, where I was tasked with enhancing their security practices within their CI/CD pipelines. I implemented a DevSecOps pipeline using Jenkins, integrating security checks throughout the development process. This not only improved the security of their applications but also ensured that the development team could continue to work efficiently without being bogged down by manual security audits.
Another project for Cisco involved optimizing their cloud infrastructure across AWS. I utilized Terraform to automate the provisioning and scaling of resources, which significantly reduced manual intervention and ensured that the infrastructure was always in line with best practices. Additionally, I automated several infrastructure tasks using Ansible, such as environment configuration, user management, and continuous deployment, which helped standardize processes and improve overall efficiency.
Skill set and Strengths:
My technical skillset includes source code management with Git and GitHub, configuration management with Ansible, and scripting in Bash and Shell. I have a solid background in Linux systems administration, which has been crucial in managing the environments in which our applications run.
One of my key strengths is my ability to troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly. Whether it's addressing deployment errors, optimizing cloud resources, or resolving security vulnerabilities, I have a proven track record of tackling challenges head-on and finding effective solutions. I am also highly collaborative, often working closely with cross-functional teams to ensure that our goals are aligned and that we are all moving in the same direction.

Career Objective:
Looking ahead, my goal is to continue growing my expertise in cloud and DevOps engineering. I am particularly interested in roles that involve architecting and implementing designs for multi-cloud environments and infrastructure setups. I am passionate about leveraging technology to deliver maximum value, whether through optimized cloud solutions, strategic infrastructure planning, or enhancing security practices.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, my experience and skills make me well-suited for roles that require a deep understanding of cloud platforms, CI/CD processes, and infrastructure automation. I am excited about the possibility of bringing my expertise to new challenges and contributing to the success of innovative projects. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.
